# VoteNow
*The Qrcode driven e-voting webapp*

## Introduction
VoteNow is a Qrcode voting webapp that enables users create, join and cast vote via Qrcode Scanning. Since we focus
on usability in order to supply voters with less technical usable scheme, the only requirement is that the user
needs to have a device containing a Qrcode Reader ðŸ˜Š.

## Motive
In one word the **Hashnode Christmas Hackathon challenge**, we set out to create something cool
and awesome for the challege but we were lacking ideas at the time, then my friend and contributor thought about creating
an evoting system or the miniture version of an evoting system and that was it.

## FrameWork
We used the Django Web Framework for this app which is strongly driven by **Python** ðŸ¤Ÿ. The Bootstrap framework was used to provide responsiveness to the frontend, javascript for interactivity and loads of css ðŸ˜‚.

## Aim
We hoped creating this would not only benefit us (skill wise) but provide accessibilty for all users to participate on equal terms. Increased accessibility for residents abroad and for persons with difficulties in travelling or reduced mobility.
And in our own simple way we have made that possible to some extent ðŸ˜‡
